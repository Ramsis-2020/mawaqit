jumuaReminder:
    text: |
      The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said
      "Whoever does the ablutions perfectly then goes to jumu`a and then listens and is silent,
      he is forgiven what is between that time and the following Friday and three more days
      and the one who touches stones has certainly made a futility"

duaAfterAthan:
    title: Invocation after adhân
    text: |
        O Allah, Master of this perfect call and the prayer that we are going to perform, gives Muhammad the power to intercede
        (the Day of Judgment) and the place of honor [in Paradise], and resurrect him in the laudable position that You promised him
        
duaBetweenAthanAndIqama:
    text: "According to Anas Ibn Mâlik, the Prophet (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam) said: The invocations between Adhân and Iqâmah are not rejected"
